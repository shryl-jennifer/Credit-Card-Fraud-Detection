# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project is purely based on Random Forest Classification Algorithm in Machine Learning.

1) Importing the required modules.

2) Loading the dataset.

3) Visualizing the data with the help of Seaborn.

4) Applying isolation forest model for anomaly detection.

5) Finally Applying the Random Forest Classification Algorithm.
